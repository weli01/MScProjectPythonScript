## Stage 2 (Readout heating rate)

### Data analysis

For analysing the MCP and MTS data from the reader to study the effect of readout heating rate on TL response.

### Glow curves

For producing the MCP and MTS glow curves for each HR.

The format for this set of glowcurves is unique from the rest due to the varying readout times for each heating rate. 
Beyond the maximum temperature of each material, the values for the set temperature were manually arranged such that the heating rate ramp kept increasing at the same rate (for example, if for HR=10°C/s, for every 0.1 s, the temp increased by 1°C, the rest of the values beyond the max temperature kept incrementing at the same rate). 
This was done such that the data points could keep on being plotted beyond the maximum temperatures.

### Reader profiles

Used in the methodology to show the different readout heating rates tested.
The data of _reader.xlsx_ was created manually.
